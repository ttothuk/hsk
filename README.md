### Question 1 - Sets
Write a function (complement) which, given a set A and a prospective universal set U, returns
the complement of A with respect to U, wrapped in the Just type constructor. Note that if the
set A is not a subset of U, then you should return Nothing. (3 marks)
Multisets are sets which allow multiple copies of the same element, but are unordered. In list
form, for example, [1,1,2,3] is equal to [1,2,3,1], but not to [1,2,3]. Multisets can be
represented as lists of pairs (a, n), which indicates that the element a appears n times in the
multiset. Write a function toMultiset which takes a list of elements, and returns a list of pairs,
representing the multiset. Note you do not need to worry about the order of the pairs in the
new list. (2 marks)
Write a function (mIntersect) that returns the multiset intersection of two multisets, using the
previous function. Note that you do not need to worry about the order of the elements in your
return value. (1 mark)

### Question 2 - Functions and Relations
The transitive closure of a relation R is the smallest relation bigger than R which is transitive.
In other words, it is R with whatever pairs added to make R transitive. Write a function
(transClosure) which takes a list of pairs (standing for R) and returns a list of pairs which is
the transitive closure of R. You do not need to worry about the order in which pairs appear in
your return value. (3 marks)

### Question 3 - Combinatorics
Write a function (missing2) which takes a list of n distinct integers, xs, and returns a list of
lists of (n − 2) integers which encode all possible ways of choosing subsets of size (n − 2) from
xs. Order each list so that the smallest integer appears first in that list; i.e. [1, 3, 4] not [1, 4, 3].
(3 marks)

### Question 4 - Primes
Special instructions. For this question, the test cases are ranked in terms of size:
- a 2-digit number (1 mark)
- a 4-digit number (1 mark)
- a 5-digit number (2 marks)
- a 6-digit number (2 marks)
- a 10-digit number (4 marks)

There is a time-limit set on the automatic marking script: if your submission times out, the
entirety of the question causing the time-out will be commented out and the script run again. In
other words, if you choose to attempt the 10-digit number parts and they time-out, you will get
no credit for otherwise correct answers to the 4-digit parts, for example. The time-limit is set
to 2 minutes per submission. You then need to decide whether or not it is worth the risk to try
to solve the larger numbers.
Write a function (nextPrimes) which takes an integer n and returns the three smallest primes
(in order) bigger than n.
Write a function (primeFactorisation) which takes an integer n and returns a list representing
the prime factorisation of n. In other words, it is possible that elements in your list will appear
more than once. It should be the case that if you multiply all of the numbers in your list
together, you get n.

### Question 5 - RSA
Write a function (eTotient) which takes an integer n, and returns the number of integers less
than n which are coprime with n. (2 marks)
Write a function (encode) which takes two numbers p and q, a message m and a number e and,
if p, q and e are suitable for use in the RSA encryption algorithm, returns the encoded message
wrapped in a Just type constructor. If they are unsuitable, return Nothing. (2 marks)
